Repository for Spotify song tracks dataset analysis, finding factors influencing popularity.
This project involved analyzing a Spotify dataset in R, where I performed data cleaning and applied machine learning algorithms to understand the factors affecting track popularity. The repository includes:

Data Cleaning: Steps taken to clean the raw dataset, handling missing values, duplicates, and feature engineering using R packages such as dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2.
Machine Learning Models:
Linear Regression: To model the relationship between audio features and track popularity.
Random Forest: To predict popularity based on a set of features and evaluate feature importance. Both methods were implemented using R packages like caret, randomForest.
Analysis and Results: Key findings based on model outputs, such as the most significant features affecting popularity and the model performance metrics.
